      City University aims to empower young minds to reach greater heights The
      vision of City University is to create a culture of excellence in higher
      education and research to accelerate national development by establishment
      of an institution of higher learning that is responsive to societyâ€™s needs
      for the 21st century and beyond. A firm resolve of our founder is that no
      merit shall be wasted only because of poverty. It is with Pride and Honor
      that City University marches forward for a better Bangladesh, for an
      achievement of excellence, and for a better tomorrow.
